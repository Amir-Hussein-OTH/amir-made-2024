## Weather Impacts on Urban Bicycle Ridership and Bike Path Planning in München

Analyzing the Impact of Weather on Urban Bicycle Traffic and Identifying Seasonal Trends: München Case Study

## Main Questions

1. To what extent do weather conditions influence the daily bicycle ridership in the city of München, and can weather-related patterns be identified?
2. How can the insights from this analysis inform the planning of bike paths in München, considering seasonal trends in bicycle usage?

## Description

This project explores the relationship between weather conditions and daily bicycle ridership in Munich.
Data collection involves daily bicycle ridership data and relevant weather data (temperature, rainfall, wind).

The analysis aims to reveal patterns, correlations, and seasonal trends.
The project helps understand the impact of weather on urban cycling and informs sustainable transportation planning.
Project Steps:
